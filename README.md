Single Page Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a Single Page Application (SPA) using only front-end technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a responsive and interactive web application that functions within a single HTML page while dynamically updating its content without reloading the browser.

A login page for user authentication.

A home interface where users can write, edit, and delete daily diary entries.

LocalStorage to save user data persistently.
